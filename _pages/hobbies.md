### Gender equality
<font size="3"> As females, we may encounter many adversities throughout our life. I am working on gender equality. I'm not sure if it can be considered a hobby, but I am dedicated to raising awareness among women that we should have the courage to construct our own identities, rather than being seen as objects under the power of men. If you are interested, you could read my articles about gender equality here:</font>

### Write fantasy novels
<font size="3">I am deeply interested in science fiction and fantasy fiction. I enjoy the process of melding my thoughts and beliefs into a story. I hope to write my own book, a successor to "Earth Sea."</font>

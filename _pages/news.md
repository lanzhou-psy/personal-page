##### Record my progress step by step

##### * 2025.05 The COI paper was accepted by Biological Psychiatry GOS &#127881;&#127881;&#127881;, in which we used ABCD data (N>10,000) to examine the association between neighborhood opportunity, cognition function and brain structure in youth. Why am I interested in neighborhood exposures? Or why does neighborbood exposome matter in youth neurodevelopment? You will read it soon.

##### * 2025.04 I also attend the neurolinguistics conference after SIRS conference at Chicago organized by Lena, which is super interesting, especially when the large language models come out, mental health practioners can do more things.&#127881;

##### * 2025.04 I went to Chicago for SIRS conference 2025. I gave two oral presentations on: 1) childhood trauma and longitudinal clinical trajectories in psychosis; 2) chidlhood trauma, psychosocial factors and psychopathology in the first-episode psychosis. &#128515; &#127881;

##### * 2024.10 My meta-analysis paper was accepted by AJP, which is my first English paper as the first author &#127881;&#127881;&#127881;. It was rejected three times by Lancet P, JAMA P and WP. Thanks God that finally it was accepted! I am happy to collaborate with Dr. Filippo Varese and Prof. Richard Bentall. Huge thanks to my master students: Lev, Travis, Sarah, Nickolas, Lea, and Sandra. I wanted to give up many times, but I feel so grateful that Richard encouraged me and sent me warm words when I felt very upset. Now we all can read this paper [here](chrome-extension://ikhdkkncnoglghljlkmcimlnlhkeamad/pdf-viewer/web/viewer.html?file=https%3A%2F%2Fpsychiatryonline.org%2Fdoi%2Fpdf%2F10.1176%2Fappi.ajp.20240456%3Fcasa_token%3DOEeP-t0uRI4AAAAA%3A2So6KViju67mU0_Z6AtYRcN4v_bVFSYo3JWjAVjwg665qOiqbnFDCrretZepKAPoutS0mFSrFA#=&zoom=130)

##### * 2024.09 I attend the experience sampling methods conference at Harlen, Netherlands. I feel such methods are promising in the mental health research.
##### * 2024.06 I presented my research on childhood adversity and brain aging at OHBM 2024, South of Korea &#129392;
##### * 2024.04 I did my oral presentation on childhood adversity and the risk of psychosis at SIRS conference in Florence, Italy. &#128515; &#127881;
 
##### * 2024.02 I got my second seed grant to study childhood adveristy, retinal structural changes in schizophrenia &#127881;    _"From the Window into the Brain: Investigating the Association between Childhood Trauma and Retinal Structural Changes in First-Episode Psychosis_", €4600, De Cock-Hadders Foundation.

##### * 2024.01 One paper published from my master's project, in which we looked at how childhood adversity influence the brain structures in participants with depressive symptoms. &#127881;  &#127881;  &#127881; Zhou, H. Y., **Zhou, L.**, Zheng, T. X., Ma, L. P., Fan, M. X., Liu, L., ... & Yan, C. (2024).

##### * 2023.12 I got my first seed grant to explore the association between childhood adversity and brain aging in mental disorders &#127881;
  
##### * 2023.09 I gave my first poster presentation at IBRO conference, Granada, Spain. It is about gray matter network changes in trauma-exposed schizophrenia &#127881;

##### * 2023.03 I gave my first oral presentation on childhood adversity and schciophrenia at BCN PhD student retreat, Groningen. &#127881; &#129395;

##### * 2023.02 I got the OHBM student fellowship, and had my mentor from the US to help me with my career development. &#129392;

##### * 2022.06 The master student I supervised, **Yael Harvey**, won the best poster award. Her thesis is about childhood adversity and cortical folding pattern in schizophrenia and bipolar. Congrats, Yael！&#127881; As her co-supervisor, I am pretty pround of her, and of course, myself. &#128526;

##### * 2022.05 I attend a very good workshop named _EMPOWER YOUR PHD_. It teaches me two very important things: first, keep an open mind; second, it is my PhD, not others'. &#128077;

##### * 2022.04 I attended my first European international conference: Congress of the Schizophrenia International Research Society (SIRS) at Florence, Italy. I began to learn how to social as one introverted person. &#128521;

##### * 2022.01 I started my PhD in Netherlands, moving from Shanghai to Groningen. I am excited but also surperised by the weather. &#128558;

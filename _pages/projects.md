#### Childhood adversity: a profound determinant of health (The Lancet Public health, 2021, 6(11): e780.)
<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 0.7;"> Childhood adversity is one big public health issue and may lead to adulthood illness, not only including mental health probelms but also many physical problems. **A safe and healthy childhood are fundamental to physical, mental, and social development.** I am deeply interested in exploring the **trans-diagnostic mechanisms of childhood adversity**. My work seeks to understand how experiences of stress, trauma, neighborhood risk and social disadvantages in childhood alter developmental processes in ways that increase risk for psychopathology. Understanding these mechanisms is critical for the development of interventions to prevent the onset of psychopathology in children who experience adversity. </span><br>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 0.7;"> I am trying to understand childhood adversity and psychopathology from different levels: </span><br>
####  * Theory/Goal Level: life history theory; the stress acceleration hypothesis
####  * Algorithm Level: accelerated aging, different attachment styles, dsyregulated emotion regulation, abnormal reward/threat processing, abnormal metabolism
####  * Implementation Level: higher inflammation, abnormal neurocognition, more risk-taking behaviours 

#### &#128226; Call for collaborator: if you are interested in childhood adversity and psychopathology, and if you have an expertise on reinforcement learning and decision making, I have some interesting research ideas in my mind and would like to share with you.

### 1. The Impact of Childhood Adversity and Trauma on Brain and Mental Health

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 0.7;"> My first research line aims to answer **what aspects or features** of brain structure, function, and behavior are shaped by early-life stress and adversity, and **what magnitude of these effects** confers vulnerability or resilience to later mental health problems. Using **multimodal neuroimaging, genetics, longitudinal data, machine learning, network modeling, and behavioral assessments**, I identify the specific brain and psychological signatures through which childhood experiences exert lasting effects on mental health. This work ultimately informs preventive and early intervention strategies that promote healthy development in at-risk populations. </span><br>

### 2. Gene and Environment Interplay on Mental Health

My second research line aims to answer how genetic predispositions interact with environmental exposures to influence mental health trajectories. By integrating genomic, environmental, and psychosocial data, I investigate how polygenic profiles moderate or mediate the impact of stress, trauma, and social context on mental health outcomes.

### 3. Computational Mechanisms of Childhood Adversity on Mental Health

My third research line aims to answer **why and how** childhood adversity alters underlying computational processes in learning, decision-making, and emotion regulation that drive mental health outcomes. Using reinforcement learning, Bayesian modeling, and network analyses, I aim to identify **latent computational mechanisms** that link early experiences to psychopathology and adaptive functioning.

### 4. Traumatic Memory and Intensive Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)

My fourth research line aims to answer **when and under what conditions** traumatic memories and emotional states fluctuate in daily life. Using intensive Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and mobile technologies, I capture fine-grained affective dynamics to understand how memory reactivation, mood, and contextual factors (i.e., physical activity, diet, pain, sleep, screen use, stress, negative life events, working status, and weather), interact to shape moment-to-moment mental health. I also aim to develop and evaluate **intervention strategies**, such as mindfulness-based and diary-based approaches, to modulate these dynamics and promote adaptive emotional regulation in daily life.

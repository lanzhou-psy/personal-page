<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 0.7;">I am a PhD student in Sommer's lab at the **Department of Biomedical Science and Department of Psychiatry, University Medical Center of Groningen**, starting in 2022.</span><br>
### Education Background:
<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 1.0;">* 2018-2021, MSc from East China Normal University, Shanghai New York University Brain and Cognitive Science Joint Institute. </span><br>
<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 1.0;">* 2013-2017, BSc from Shanghai Jiao Tong University</span><br>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 1.0;">Currently, I am involved in an exciting national-wide clinical trial [HAMLETT STUDY](https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-019-3822-5) in the Netherlands. My PhD research revolves around ***understanding the influence of childhood adversities on the clinical course, cognition, and brain development of individuals with schizophrenia***, mainly supervised by Prof. Dr. [Iris Sommer](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=CVy4SaUAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. Marieke Begemann. I am applying machine learning, neuroimaging, genectics, and gragh-based network analysis in my research. I am also collaborating on large neuroimaging datasets, like [ENIGMA](https://enigma.ini.usc.edu/), [ABCD](https://abcdstudy.org/) and ZIB. </span><br>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 0.7;">**Research Keywords: Childhood Adversities, Sczhizophrenia, Developmental Psychopathology, Neuroimaging, Network Neuroscience, Machine Learning**</span><br>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 1.0;">Beyond my academic pursuits, I am deeply committed to **addressing gender inequality and advocating for the rights of children and women**. In the future, I aspire to conduct research in these areas and establish a nonprofit organization focused on exploring the social, psychological, and structural factors contributing to health disparities. My goal is to identify effective strategies to promote health equity and overall well-being.</span><br>

### In Industy

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 1.0;">From 2020 to 2021, I worked as a **Medical Affairs Intern at Pfizer** for 8 months. During my internship, I provided academic support for antibiotics products, specifically Cefoperazone-Sulbactam and Ceftazidime-Avibactam. Additionally, I assisted to do **policy research** related to volume-based procurement in China.</span><br>


<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 1.0;">From 2017 to 2018, I served as a **Medical Affairs Assistant at Chisie pharmaceutical company**. I was responsible for Drug Safety of Respiratory & Neonatal drugs, and diligently reported Adverse Events to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</span><br>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 0.7;">I am a PhD student in Sommer's lab at the **Department of Biomedical Science and Department of Psychiatry, University Medical Center of Groningen**, starting in 2022.</span><br>
### Education Background:
<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 1.0;">* 2018-2021, MSc from East China Normal University. </span><br>
<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 1.0;">* 2013-2017, BSc from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. </span><br>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 1.0;">Currently, I am involved in an exciting national-wide clinical trial [HAMLETT STUDY](https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-019-3822-5) in the Netherlands. My PhD research revolves around ***understanding the influence of childhood adversities on the clinical course, cognition, and brain development of individuals with schizophrenia***, mainly supervised by Prof. Dr. [Iris Sommer](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=CVy4SaUAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. Marieke Begemann. I am applying machine learning and gragh-based network analysis in my research. I am also collaborating on large neuroimaging datasets, like [ENIGMA](https://enigma.ini.usc.edu/), [ABCD](https://abcdstudy.org/) and ZIB. </span><br>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 0.7;">**Research Keywords: Childhood Adversities, Sczhizophrenia, Developmental Psychopathology, Neuroimaging, Network Neuroscience, Machine Learning**</span><br>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 1.0;">Beyond my academic pursuits, I am committed to addressing **mental health inequality** and advocating for improved access to mental health services for all individuals. I believe that everyone deserves equal opportunities to lead a healthy life, free from the burdens of mental health challenges.</span><br>

### Before My PhD
### In Academia
<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 1.0;">From 2021 to 2022, I served as a **Co-coordinator** for the **College Student Cohort** (n=5000) at the [Zhangjiang International Brain Biobank](https://zib.fudan.edu.cn/index), East China Normal University (ECNU) site in Shanghai. My responsibilities included coordinating data collection (MRI, blood sample, neurocognition, questionnaire, EMA) and research activities for the cohort.</span><br>


<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 1.0;">From 2018 to 2021, I pursued my **Master's in Cognitive Neuroscience** at [NYU-ECNU Brain and Cognitive Science Joint Research Institute](https://bcs.shanghai.nyu.edu/en), ECNU, Shanghai. During my Master's program, I received comprehensive training in **Neuroimaging, Experimental Neuroscience, and Developmental Psychopathology**. Concurrently, I completed a 1.5-year internship at the psychiatric outpatient at Shanghai Mental Health Center, where I interviewed patients and received training in clinical assessments. My internship was supervised by Prof. dr. Zhenghui Yi (Psychiatrist). </span><br>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 1.0;"> For my Master's thesis, I conducted research on ***the Neuro-Mechanism of Reward Representation Maintenance in Schizophrenia and Schizotypy using task-based fMRI***, supervised by Dr. [Chao Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fMJTuuEAAAAJ&hl=en), and Dr. Zhaoxin Wang. This research aimed to understand the **anhedonia** symptoms in schizophrenia and schizotypy, which contributed to the broader field of negative symptoms.</span><br>


<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 1.0;">From 2013 to 2017, I pursued a **combined Bachelor program in Public Health/Nursing** at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Throughout my studies, I received comprehensive training in various disciplines, including **Biomedical Sciences, Biostatistics, Epidemiology, Health Promotion, Health Management, and Clinical Nursing Practices**. In 2014, I chose **Psychology** as my minor due to strong interests in brain and mental health.</span><br>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 1.0;">During my Bachelor's program, I actively engaged in two projects. One project involved **modeling the deposition of air pollutants (PM 2.5)** in the respiratory system and exploring its damage on the cardiovascular system among marathon athletes. Another project was inverstigating the turnover intention among nurses in long-term care in Shanghai.</span><br>


### In Industy

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 1.0;">From 2020 to 2021, I had the opportunity to work as a **Medical Affairs Intern at Pfizer** for 8 months. During my internship, I provided valuable academic support for antibiotics products, specifically Cefoperazone-Sulbactam and Ceftazidime-Avibactam. Additionally, I assisted to do **policy research** related to volume-based procurement in China.</span><br>


<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 1.0;">From 2017 to 2018, I served as a **Medical Affairs Assistant at Chisie pharmaceutical company**. In this role, I was responsible for Drug Safety of Respiratory & Neonatal drugs, and diligently reported Adverse Events to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</span><br>

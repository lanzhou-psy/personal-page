## Research
* **Collaborate research on childhood adversity and psychopathology**. Feel free to reach out and let's work together!
 
* **Statistical/data analytical help** in (80% using R, 20% using Python and Matlab):
  * classic methods (T test, ANOVA, ANCOVA, etc.)
  * graph-based network analysis (path length, cluster coefficients, small worldness index, etc.)
  * classic algorithms in machine learning (Kmeans, logistic regressions, PCA, ICA) 
  * longitudinal data analysis (Linear mixed-effect model)
  * meta-analysis (multilevel method for behavioral data, ALE for neuroimaging data)
  * task-based fMRI data analysis
  * structural MRI: freeSurfer for T1 and T2 data, TBSS for DTI data
  
* **Psychological experiments design**, especially when you want to do task-based fMRI or EEG. I can provide help to adpot experiments using Eprime or PsychoPy. But my expertise on experiment design mainly are for decision making tasks and cognition tasks, such as stroop, n-back, MID, delay discounting.

## Others
* **Share your research**: I am co-organizing CNC Journal Club in my institute. If you are willing to share your research on Brain, Psychiatry, Neuroimaging, I would be very happy to send you an invitation. We usually do this in Wednesday each two weeks. Please do not hesitate to contact me;)

* **Bachelor/Master thesis supervison**: Sommer's lab is recruiting interns per semester, I can help you if you are intereted in childhood adversity/environmental risk factors and schizophrenia.
  
* **European PhD positions application consulting**: if you want to know how to apply PhD position or the experiences of doing a PhD in Europe, feel free to reach out.

### Before My PhD
### In Academia
<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 1.0;">From 2021 to 2022, I served as a **Co-coordinator** for the **College Student Cohort** (n=5000) at the [Zhangjiang International Brain Biobank](https://zib.fudan.edu.cn/index), East China Normal University (ECNU) site in Shanghai. My responsibilities included coordinating data collection (MRI, blood sample, neurocognition, questionnaire, EMA) and research activities for the cohort.</span><br>


<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 1.0;">From 2018 to 2021, I pursued my **Master's in Cognitive Neuroscience** at [NYU-ECNU Brain and Cognitive Science Joint Research Institute](https://bcs.shanghai.nyu.edu/en), ECNU, Shanghai. During my Master's program, I received comprehensive training in **Neuroimaging, Experimental Neuroscience, and Developmental Psychopathology**. Concurrently, I completed a 1.5-year internship at the psychiatric outpatient at Shanghai Mental Health Center, where I interviewed patients and received training in clinical assessments. My internship was supervised by Prof. dr. Zhenghui Yi (Psychiatrist). </span><br>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 1.0;"> For my Master's thesis, I conducted research on ***the Neuro-Mechanism of Reward Representation Maintenance in Schizophrenia and Schizotypy using task-based fMRI***, supervised by Dr. [Chao Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fMJTuuEAAAAJ&hl=en), and Dr. Zhaoxin Wang. This research aimed to understand the **anhedonia** symptoms in schizophrenia and schizotypy, which contributed to the broader field of negative symptoms.</span><br>


 <span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 1.0;"> From 2013 to 2017, I pursued a **combined Bachelor program in Public Health/Nursing** at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Throughout my studies, I received comprehensive training in various disciplines, including **Biomedical Sciences, Biostatistics, Epidemiology, Health Promotion, Health Management, and Clinical Nursing Practices**. From 2014 to 2017, I studied **Psychology** as my second major due to strong interests in brain and mental health.</span><br>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; line-height: 1.0;">During my Bachelor's program, I actively engaged in the project **modeling the deposition of air pollutants (PM 2.5)** in the respiratory system and exploring its damage on the cardiovascular system among marathon athletes.</span><br>

### MRI T1 data processing using FreeSurfer
<font size="3">
Wanna know how to use <b>Python and FreeSurfer (recon-all)</b> to do the T1 data processing 
and get the brain features (e.g., Volume, Surface, Thickness)? 
You can find the scripts and tutorial

### Charting the brain structure deviations in psychiatric disorders across lifespan using normative modeling
<font size="3">
Normative modeling is like making a map of what is “typical” for the brain so we can see how an individual brain compares. It’s powerful because instead of just comparing groups (e.g., “patients vs. healthy”), it lets us understand each person’s brain in the context of typical development and variation.
  The PCN toolkit will be used in the tutorial
  <a href = "https://github.com/lanzhou-psy/Normative-Modeling/blob/main/README.md">here</a> in Python.

Currently, this book is not available. 
But you can get some open access materials offered by me and my colleague, e.g.,
